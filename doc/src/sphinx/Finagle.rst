Finagle Integration
===================

You can generate `finagle <https://github.com/twitter/finagle>`_ binding code
by passing the `--finagle` option to scrooge. For each thrift service, Scrooge
will generate a wrapper class that builds Finagle services both on the server
and client sides.

Here's an example, assuming your thrift service is

::

    service BinaryService {
      binary fetchBlob(1: i64 id)
    }

Scrooge generates the following wrapper classes:

::

    import com.twitter.finagle.Service
    import com.twitter.finagle.thrift.{ThriftClientRequest,
      ThriftServerFramedCodec, ThriftClientFramedCodec}
    import com.twitter.util.Future

    /*
     The server side service wrapper takes a thrift protocol factory (to
     specify which wire protocol to use) and an implementation of
     BinaryService[Future]
    */
    class BinaryService$FinagleService(
      iface: BinaryService[Future],
      val protocolFactory: TProtocolFactory
    ) extends Service[Array[Byte], Array[Byte]]

    /*
     The client wrapper implements BinaryService[Future].
    */
    class BinaryService$FinagleClient(
      val service: Service[ThriftClientRequest, Array[Byte]],
      val protocolFactory: TProtocolFactory = new TBinaryProtocol.Factory,
      override val serviceName: String = "",
      stats: StatsReceiver = NullStatsReceiver
    ) extends BinaryService[Future] {
      /*
        The method call encodes method name along with arguments in
        ThriftClientRequest and sends to the server, then decodes server
        response to reconstruct the return value.
      */
      def fetchBlob(id: Long): Future[ByteBuffer]
    }

To create a server, you need to provide an implementation of the service
interface and use it with Finagle's Thrift object.

::

    // provide an implementation of the future-base service interface
    class MyImpl extends BinaryService[Future] {
      ...
    }
    val service = Thrift.serveIface("host:port", new MyImpl)

Creating a client is easy, you just provide Finagle's Thrift object the
iface.

::

    val client = Thrift.newIface[BinaryService[Future]]("host:port")

In both the server and client cases, you probably want to pass more
configuration parameters to finagle, so check the finagle documentation for
tweaks once you get things to compile.
