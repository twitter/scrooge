# scrooge

Scrooge is a thrift code generator for scala.

It's meant to be a drop-in replacement for the apache thrift code generator.

Since scala is API-compatible with java, you can use the apache thrift code
generator to generate java files and use them from within scala, but the
overhead of converting to/from java containers can sometimes be annoying.
This is an attempt to bypass the problem by generating scala code directly.
It also uses scala syntax so the generated code is *much* smaller.

The generated code still depends on libthrift.

There is a fairly comprehensive set of unit tests, which actually generate
code, compile it, and execute it to verify expectations.


## Building

To build scrooge, use sbt:

    $ sbt package-dist


## Features

- Generates native scala thrift codecs, using case classes and functions.

- Generated code is templated using a mustache variant, making it easy to
  edit.

- Finagle client/server adaptors, and Ostrich wrappers, can be optionally
  generated at the same time.


## Running Scrooge

A starter script is built into `dist/scrooge/scripts`. You can run that or
write your own.

To get command line help:

    $ scrooge --help

To generate source with content written to the current directory:

    $ scrooge <thrift-file1> [<thrift-file2> ...]

To generate source with content written to a specified directory, using
extra include paths, rebuilding only those files that have changed:

    $ scrooge
      -d <target-dir>
      -i <include-path>
      -s
      <thrift-file1> [<thrift-file2> ...]


## Runtime dependency

There are a couple of classes needed by the generated code. These have been
moved out of scrooge into a separate jar to keep dependencies small:

    val scrooge_runtime = "com.twitter" % "scrooge-runtime" % "1.0.3"


## SBT Plugin

There's a plugin for SBT (0.7.x) which is meant to be a drop-in replacement
for sbt-thrift:

[https://github.com/twitter/sbt-scrooge](https://github.com/twitter/sbt-scrooge)

To use it, replace the "sbt-thrift" line in your `Plugins.scala` file with:

    val sbtScrooge = "com.twitter" % "sbt-scrooge" % "1.1.1"

(or whatever the current version is) and add `with CompileThriftScroogeMixin`
or `with CompileThriftScrooge` to your project's mixin list. More details are
in the sbt-scrooge `README`.

## Implementation Semantics

Thrift is severely underspecified with respect to the handling of
required/optional/unspecified-requiredness and default values in various cases
such as serialization, deserialization, and new instance creation, and
different implementations do different things (see
http://lionet.livejournal.com/66899.html for a good analysis).

Scrooge attempts to be as rigourous as possible in this regard with
consistently applied and hopefully easy to understand rules.

1. if neither "required" nor "optional" is declared for a field, it then has the default requiredness of "optional-in/required-out", or "optInReqOut" for short;
2. it is invalid for a required field to be null and an exception will be thrown if you attempt to serialize a struct with a null required field;
3. it is invalid for a required field to be missing during deserialization, and an exception will be thrown if this case happens;
4. optional fields can be set or unset, and the set-state is meaningful state of the struct that should be preserved by serialization/deserialization; unset fields are not present in the serialized representation of the struct;
5. declared default values will be assigned to any non-required fields that are missing during deserialization; if no default is declared for a field, a default value appropriate for the type will be used (see below);
6. \#4 and \#5 imply that optional-with-default-value is not a tenable combination, and will be treated as if "optional" was not specified (optInReqOut-with-default-value);

#### Default values by type:
- bool = false
- byte/i16/i32/i64/double = 0
- string/struct/enum = null
- list = Seq()
- set = Set()
- map = Map()

The following "matrix" defines all the scenarios where a value may not be present and how that case is handled:

#### required, no declared default value:
- missing in deserialization:
    - throws TProtocolException
- null in serialization:
    - throws TProtocolException
- immutable instance instantiation:
    - must be explicitly provided

#### required, with declared default value:
- missing in deserialization:
    - throws TProtocolException
- null in serialization:
    - throws TProtocolException
- immutable instance instantiation:
    - declared default value

#### optInReqOut, no declared default value:
- missing in deserialization:
    - default value for type
- null in serialization:
    - throws TProtocolException
- immutable instance instantiation:
    - must be explicitly provided

#### optInReqOut, with declared default value:
- missing in deserialization:
    - declared default value
- null in serialization:
    - throws TProtocolException
- immutable instance instantiation:
    - declared default value

#### optional, no declared default value:
- missing in deserialization:
    - None
- None in serialization:
    - omitted
- immutable instance instantiation:
    - None

#### optional, with declared default value:
- case not valid, treated as optInReqOut with declared default value
