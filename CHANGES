3.2.0
~~~~~
- BREAKING CHANGE:
Make java gen experimental. There are changes coming down the pipe that

of a name collision
- eliminate the possibility of namespace collision for "runtime"
- revert identification of Enums and TType.ENUM (back to I32)
- eliminate all use of ThriftUtil unless it's needed

3.1.9
~~~~~

- [EXPERIMENTAL] add ability to pass through additional fields
enable with --enable-passthrough
- Create the ability to map includes to directories to bridge scrooge2 and
scrooge3 maven layouts

java.nio.charset.UnmappableCharacterException
- generator: Replace backslash with forward slash in file URI

- optimize empty collections on deserialization
- upgrade to finagle 6.4.0 and util 6.3.4

3.1.1
~~~~~

- BREAKING CHANGE:
We finally made scrooge-runtime to be backward with Scrooge 2. This requires
a name change for the ThriftStructCodec. From now on, all objects generated
by Scrooge 3 will use ThriftStructCodec3.
This will affect you only if your code is using ThriftStructCodec directly,
which is not common.
- scrooge now releases jar-with-dependencies
- add language option tag to scrooge-maven-plugin, thanks to @eirslett
- some directory reorganization of the demos

3.1.0
~~~~~

- Dependency changes: now on util/finagle 6.3.0
- demo project now shows how to construct finagle server and client using
generated code
- --ostrich flag implies --finagle flag

3.0.9
~~~~~

- Remove "provided" scope of finagle in scrooge-runtime. So it brings Finagle
6.1.0 as transit dependency to your project
- Make the generated Scala code backward compatible with Finagle 5. The impact
to users on Finagle 6 is that you will see a lot of warnings saying that
tracerFactory is deprecated.

3.0.8
~~~~~

- When scrooge-maven-plugin extracts Thrift files from a dependency artifact, it
now puts them in a sub folder named after the artifact id. This way, the user
project can use same-named Thrift files from different artifacts.
- Title case and camel case more consistent with previous version before 3.0.7
We still preserve consecutive upper cases but not in an all-up-case string, eg:

::

TBird (original) -> tBird (camel case) -> TBird (title case)
HTML (original) -> html (camel case) -> Html (title case)

Thanks to @erikvanoosten
- Finagle client can throw exception on void function. Thanks to @brancek
- Support documentation on enum values. Thanks to @erikvanoosten
- Reorganizing test folder, and add Apache standard test

3.0.7
~~~~~

- All on-wire names in the Thrift messages are now consistent with
Apache generated code. This allows Scrooge generated services to exchange
Thrift messages with Apache generated services.
- Title case ids now preserve consecutive upper case letters. Eg:

::

TBird (original) -> Tbird (old) -> TBird (now)

See test case in scrooge-generator/src/test/scala/com/twitter/scrooge/ASTSpec.scala
- scrooge-maven-plugin now enforces an explicit white list in <dependencyConfig>.
The old behavior is that if a dependency artifact has a "idl" classifier, we
will extract thrift files from it to compile. The new behavior is that the
artifact must be explicitly included in <dependencyConfig>. The dependencies
here include both direct dependencies(specified in project pom file) and
indirect dependencies (everything in the dependency tree).
- Now supports "scala" as a namespace scope. It is treated same as "java".
- Now supports "*" as a default namespace scope

3.0.6
~~~~~

- Released a scrooge-maven-plugin, for maven projects to integrate Scrooge in
their pom files. Also released a demo of how to use scrooge-maven-plugin
- scrooge-runtime is now backward compatible with scrooge-runtime 2.X.X. The
following classes and methods are deprecated:
- FinagleThriftClient
- FinagleThriftService
- ThriftStructCodec.decoder
- ThriftStructCodec.encoder
- scrooge-runtime now can introspect generated ThriftStruct. See the new
ThriftStructMetaData class.
- BREAKING: in scrooge-runtime, com.twitter.ScroogeOption is now renamed to
just Option. This is mainly for Java code. But if you need to use it in
Scala code, make sure to address ambiguity with scala.Option.
- Updated APIs of scrooge-generator. See com.twitter.scrooge.Compiler class
- Fix the stats reporting for the java scrooge thrift code generation

3.0.5
~~~~~

Bug fixes

- Constant definitions now can be of "set" type.
- Fix letter cases of enum fields(Java uses upper case; Scala uses title case)

Dependencies

- Remove dependency on org.scalatest, com.twitter.scalatest (not in Maven
Central)
- Update dependency of util/finagle/ostrich to 6.1.0
- Project dependencies are all in Maven Central now. You don't need to have
access to Twitter internal repository anymore.

3.0.4
~~~~~

Features:

- add --dry-run option to parse and validate source thrift files, reports any
errors, but does not emit any generated source code. It can be used with
--gen-file-mapping to get the file mapping

Bug fixes

- union types now can contain primitive types.
- constants defined in the same file now can be referenced.

Dependencies

- Update dependency of util/finagle/ostrich to 6.0.6

3.0.3
~~~~~

- Scrooge artifacts now deploys to Maven central via Sonatype
- Scrooge project builds in Travis CI
- Features
- Fully qualifying ids imported by "include" statements. We don't generate
"import" statements anymore.
- Remove unnecessary finagle jar dependencies for vanilla generated code.
- Add tests
- non-finagle usage; see NonFinagleSpec.scala
- struct immutability and deep copying; see ImmutableStructSpec.scala
- Bug fixes
- move "validate" method from Scala struct trait to object, so that the thrift
struct can define a "validate" field without name clashing.

3.0.2
~~~~~

- Adding a "--gen-file-map <path>" option to Scrooge command line. It tells
what output files each input Thrift files generates, in the following format:

::

inputPath/input.thrift -> outputPath/Constants.scala
inputPath/input.thrift -> outputPath/FooStruct.scala

- The generated enums now have a common trait ThriftEnum(defined in
scrooge-runtime), that allows you to query the name as well as the value of
the enum field.
- The generated Scala enums now are Java-serializable.
- The generated FinagledClient class takes val arguments to make "service",
"protocol" accessible:

::

class FinagledClient(
val service: ...,
val protocol: ...,
val serviceName: ...
stats: ...
)

3.0.1
~~~~~

Features and bug fixes

- Doc comments are included in the generated code.
- Generated exception structs now have getMessage() method
- Generate header that emits Scrooge version
- You can now import a directory or a Jar/Zip file through command line
argument, which will be stored in a chain of paths maintained by Scrooge.
Then refer to a file using relative path in the thrift "include" statement.
Scrooge will locate the file in the path chain.
- Introduce a "strict" mode that defaults to on. Unfavored syntax throws an
exception when "strict" mode is on and prints a warning when it's off. The
strict mode can be disabled by specifying the "--disable-strict" argument.
- The "oneway" modifier is treated as an OnewayNotSupportedException in strict
mode and a warning in non-strict mode.
- Support Union types. Given:

::

union Point {
1: double x
2: double y
3: Color color = BLUE
}

Scrooge generates:
sealed trait Point
object Point {
case class X(x: Double) extends Point
case class Y(y: Double) extends Point
case class Count(color: Color = Color.Blue) extends Point
}

The "required" and "optional" modifiers in a union type will throw
exceptions in strict mode and print warnings in non-strict mode.
- Have a common trait ThriftException for all the thrift exception structs.
- Support cross file service inheritance. Now you can do
include "foo.thrift"
service MyService extends foo.FooService { ... }
- Bug fix: It couldn't resolve a symbol imported through a relative path and
threw an UndefinedSymbolException
- Bug fix: namespace aliasing put the parentheses in the wrong place.
- Bug fix: services using binary fields wouldn't compile
- Bug fix: cross-file const referencing didn't work

Implementation updates

- Project structure:
- frontend: Importer and ThriftParser
- mustache: everything related to mustache, including template parser, loader
and handlebar
- ast: Thrift AST definition
- backend: code generation include various generators and dictionaries to
hydrate Mustache templates.
- Redefine clear and separate responsibilities of each components:
- Move ID manipulation(concatenation, case conversion, keyword rewriting etc)
to Generator phase.
- Utilizing Scala static type checking to enforce scoping correctness by
introducing SimpleID and QualifiedID to AST.
- Enforce dictionary key uniqueness for nested Mustache templates.
- Scrooge project is now on Maven
- Delete obsolete code and tests

Dependencies:

- Upgraded to util 5.3.13, finagle 5.3.30
- Removed dependency on sbt
- Add dependency on maven

3.0.0
~~~~~

- Java code generation is now supported!
- Scala code now generates a set of classes for each struct:
- a base trait
- an immutable case class (used as the default implementation)
- a proxy trait (to make it easy to build proxy classes)
- Moved scrooge-runtime into the same repo with scrooge, which is now called
scrooge-generator. Both projects will keep version numbers in sync now.
- Changed the way required/optional is treated on fields, and default values,
to more closely match the way Apache Thrift works. (This is described in
more detail in a new section of the README.)
- Fixed constant sets.
- Fixed thread safety in finagle ThriftServer.
- Fixed the resolution of #include directives that follow relative paths.
- Removed the finagle dependency from scrooge-runtime so that code generated
with scrooge can be loosely coupled with finagle, or optionally not depend
on finagle at all (if you don't build finagle bindings).
- Fixed typedef references that were relative to #included files.
- Made various improvements to the internal template system.
- Fixed test speed by using scrooge to generate code that the tests build
against, avoiding runtime evaluation.

Dependencies:

- Upgraded to thrift 0.8.0, util 4.0, and finagle 4.0.
- Upgraded to sbt 0.11.2.
- Upgraded to scala 2.9.2.

2.x
-----

2.5.4
~~~~~

- Addressed an issue where structs with the same name but from different
namespaces/packages would conflict. Now using a package alias to
disambiguate.


2.5.3
~~~~~

- Minor bug fix for serviceName name class with.


2.4.0
~~~~~

- added support for structs with more than 22 fields, which previously was the
limit as that is the max case-class size in scala. For structs larger than
this, instead of using case-classes, normal classes are used but with most of
the case-class boilerplate support code also generated, allowing these structs
to be used as if they were case-classes. The only exception is that there is
no unapply method; but do you really want to unapply 23+ fields in a match
statement?


2.3.1
~~~~~

- thriftProtocolFactory in generated ThriftServer now has
type of TProtocolFactory, so you can override it with other
protocol factories.


2.3.0
~~~~~

- You can now override serverBuilder in ThriftServer to provide
additional server configuration
- The protocol factory to the FinagledClient now has a default
value of TBinaryProtocol.Factory, which means you don't have
to specify it when using the default.


2.2.0
~~~~~

- tracerFactory support in ThriftServer.

2.1.0
~~~~~

- Support for tracing in server.

2.0.2
~~~~~

- fixes a bug in which namespace mapping was not applied
recursively to included documents.


2.0.1
~~~~~

- fixes a bug in which qualified service names from imported
thrift files were not resolved properly.


2.0.0
~~~~~

- fixes a bug with enum in which the first value was wrong.

1.x
-----

1.1.1
~~~~~

- scrooge-runtime-1.0.1
- Each thrift struct companion object now extends ThriftStructCodec
- Correctly resolving enum constants and Const values.
- Title-casing enum value names.
- Added support for namespace renaming from the command line.
