# Scrooge language implementations that live outside of the scrooge directory
# benefit from being able to depend on GoldFileTest.
# In order to make GoldFileTest available to other pants targets as a dependency
# it needs to belong to its own 'java_library' target, ideally without additional
# dependencies like all the unit tests below (depending on all those extra tests would
# cause them to be run twice anyway). So here we define a small pants target for just
# GoldFileTest and the dependencies it needs and expose it as a 'java_library'.
#
# Below, in the junit_tests target we depend on this 'lib' target, but make sure to exclude
# these sources, as we want to depend on the pants target that 'owns' the sources and not the
# source files directly. Depending directly on the source files breaks a pants rule that
# no 2 targets can 'own' the same source files.
#
# NOTE: In the future, we should consider splitting GoldFileTest into its own jvm package
# with its own BUILD file which would simplify this.
